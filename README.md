# Smugglers Cove

(WIP) A new game you might want to try out.

This app contains the rules and a team generator.

## Development

_Note that you will need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) installed._

Clone the repo and install the dependencies...

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Vehmloewff/smugglers-cove
cd smugglers-cove
npm install
```

...then start [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org):

```bash
npm run dev
```

Navigate to [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000). You should see your app running. Edit a component file in `src`, save it, and reload the page to see your changes.

By default, the server will only respond to requests from localhost. To allow connections from other computers, edit the `sirv` commands in package.json to include the option `--host 0.0.0.0`.
